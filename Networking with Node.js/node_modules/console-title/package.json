Your terminal emulator must support the escape sequence.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, this is accomplished though a call to the native `SetConsoleTitle` API; thus, you must have a working build environment for this module to function.  However, if the native code build fails, your application will still work.  Calls to set the console title will be silently ignored.",
