  "readme": "# js-gc\r\nAn API for Javascript to trigger the Garbage Collector\r\n\r\n## Background\r\njs-gc is written for when there is memory-intensive code which needs to run on multiple platforms. In theory, the environment's garbage collector should run automatically. In practice, this isn't always true. Thankfully, most environments also provide a means to manually run the garbage collector. Sadly, there is not a standardized interface for this, so multi-platform support is convoluted. This API plans to make that problem less terrible.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```\r\nnpm install js-gc\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n### In Node.js\r\n```\r\nvar gc=require(\"js-gc\");\r\n/*A massive memory intense task*/\r\ngc();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### In browser code\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"link/to/js-gc/index.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\n/*A massive memory intense task*/\r\nwindow.gc();\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Supported Platforms\r\njs-gc doesn't work everywhere. It works on these platforms so far:\r\n* Opera 7+\r\n* Rhino\r\n* Nashorn\r\n* Duktape, in theory.\r\n* JerryScript, in theory.\r\n* IE 5+, with ActiveX controls enabled\r\n* Chakra\r\n* Obsolete versions of Firefox\r\n* Node.js, but only the V8 based versions, and only if global.gc is enabled.\r\n* V8 in certain conditions\r\n\r\nIf an unsupported environment is encountered, the gc function will be a function that doesn't do anything.\r\n",
